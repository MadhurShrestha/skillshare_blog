                          ‘I understand when they say we still have 14 players, but if you look in detail a bit more at who the 14 players are, you see Trevoh Chalobah with two training sessions, Mateo Kovacic with one training session, N’Golo Kante with one training session. We were putting a huge risk on the players physically and because of Covid.
                          ‘I cannot and will not comment on any other decision made from other games being postponed or not postponed. We never compared ourselves to any other situation, we were just worried about the safety of players. The players were concerned about their health because we had several positive Covid tests in consecutive days.’- Thomas Tuchel

                          Constructed around 40 years later, the Pantheon houses a mind-bending dome that spans 43m of air and culminates in a pupil-like circular window at its apex known as the oculus that floods the interior with natural light. The name Pantheon, which combines the Greek words for "all" and "gods", suggests a religious function, but some historians think the monument was mainly constructed to pay tribute to Roman emperors. Despite the ravages of time, the iconic half-sphere remains intact and is still the world's largest unreinforced concrete dome.

                          When it came to building big, the Romans clearly knew what they were doing. Nearly 2,000 years after they were constructed, these two enormous and technically astounding structures have withstood earthquakes, floods and military conflicts, long outlasting the empire that spawned them and becoming physical embodiments of the enduring influence of Roman culture across the globe.

                          Analysis by the BBC and security organisation Checkpoint found that over a seven-month period between December 2020 and July 2021, Telegram channels offering Covid passes for unvaccinated people in multiple languages grew from below 10 to more than 1,000.

                          One Telegram channel claiming to offer NHS and EU digital Covid passports has amassed more than 180,000 subscribers since 14 December.

                          The BBC has contacted Telegram for comment.

                          For Mr Benton, the task of catching fraudsters is a difficult one, and counterfeiting is "impossible" to stop.

                          Minimalism is a tool that can assist you in finding freedom. Freedom from fear. Freedom from worry. Freedom from overwhelm. Freedom from guilt. Freedom from depression. Freedom from the trappings of the consumer culture we’ve built our lives around. Real freedom.
                          That doesn’t mean there’s anything inherently wrong with owning material possessions. Today’s problem seems to be the meaning we assign to our stuff: we tend to give too much meaning to our things, often forsaking our health, our relationships, our passions, our personal growth, and our desire to contribute beyond ourselves. Want to own a car or a house? Great, have at it! Want to raise a family and have a career? If these things are important to you, then that’s wonderful. Minimalism simply allows you to make these decisions more consciously, more deliberately.
